  <em>Open source burning software for the Mac</em>
</p>

---

## Why?

Every CD/DVD burning app on macOS is either abandonware, closed-source, overpriced, or all three. I got tired of dealing with clunky, proprietary software just to burn a disc — so I decided to build my own.

BurnMan is a native macOS app built with SwiftUI that wraps powerful open-source tools in a clean, modern interface. It's designed for macOS 26 but it's old school.
